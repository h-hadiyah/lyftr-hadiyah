// Load persisted state before the first paint. The stores' API is async because
// mobile's Keychain genuinely is; on web every read is localStorage underneath, so
// this settles within a microtask and nothing visible waits on it.
//
// Rendering first and hydrating after would show one frame of default state, and the
// screens that read these do it in mount-only effects — the gym-layout election never
// re-runs, so a frame is not a flicker there, it is the wrong layout for the session.
//
// A rejection still renders: the app's defaults are usable, and a blank page because
// localStorage was unavailable (Safari private mode, storage disabled) would be a far
// worse failure than starting with an empty server URL.

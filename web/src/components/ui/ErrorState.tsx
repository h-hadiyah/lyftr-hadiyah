// A load that failed, said as a state rather than as a banner over the wreckage.
//
// Empty and error are different outcomes and the design systems that bother to separate
// them all say so (Carbon, PatternFly, the Agriculture DS). Empty means we heard back and
// there is nothing; error means we did not hear back at all. Rendering the page's
// components anyway — a KPI tile reading 0, a chart with no line — states the first while
// the second is true, and a red bar above them does not undo that. The zeros are not a
// styling problem, they are wrong.
//
// `size` follows Geist's rule: full-page when the route itself is unusable, section when
// one region inside an otherwise-working page failed. A failed workouts LIST keeps its
// search box and its "Log Workout" button, so that is a section. A failed dashboard has
// nothing truthful left to draw, so that is a page.
//
// Anatomy is the shared one: mark, Title Case title, sentence-case body, at most one
// primary action and one secondary. `message` is whatever apiErrorMessage produced, so
// the specific cause — unreachable, timed out, cleartext blocked, 5xx — is already in the
// words and does not need a second icon to encode it.

          PatternFly draws the line exactly here: icons are grey by default "except when
          used as a status icon", and it names our case — "inability to get data,
          backend failure" — as the red one. Only the mark is tinted; painting the whole
          page red would be alarming rather than legible, and the copy carries the detail. */}

// The last net under a PR whose whole subject is that a failure must be visible.
//
// Everything else here catches failures we ANTICIPATED — a rejected promise, a 502, a
// list page that never arrived. A render that throws is the one we did not, and React's
// answer to an uncaught throw is to unmount the entire tree: a white screen, no nav, no
// way back except a manual reload, which is the least visible failure the app can have.
// Found by feeding the workout list a row whose started_at would not parse — one bad row
// out of ten took down the page, and React logged the standard "Consider adding an error
// boundary" warning because there was not one anywhere in the codebase.
//
// This does not excuse a crash: the underlying bug still gets fixed. It bounds the damage
// to the region that threw, so an unknown future throw costs a section instead of the app.
